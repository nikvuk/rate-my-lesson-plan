## Workshop Activity Outline

In this workshop you will learn how to build an interface to rate your lesson! Submitting feedback after each lesson gives your teacher the opporunity to continually improve your lessons. During this session you will learn how to write the basic code and build the physical interface to put up in your classroom.

## Planned Learning Outcomes

* Learn to break up a problem into smaller logical chunks to solve
* Basic computer programming logic - initially through block code, then a coding language (Python)
* Introduction to electronics
* Teamwork - reflecting how engineers work in the industry
* The value of feedback from your peers and mentors

## Final Outcome

The microbit records your button presses as rating for the lesson (positive or negative), acknowledges your input, and displays the current ratings score (see the photo).
*Add PHOTO*
You will have had a chance to experiment with your code, try different things and review each other's work.

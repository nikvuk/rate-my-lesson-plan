We worked with the charity Young Engineers to write a worksheet to be used
in schools to team programming.

Young Engineers is a national charity (incorporated in 2000) that aims to
inspire young people about the potential, importance, and excirtement of a
career in engingeering. HRH the Duke of York has been the Patron of Young
Engineers since 2004.

The team received a brief on the charity's goals and work from Heather,
along with advice on the scope our activity should have, and instructions on how
to write our proposal up.

We came up with an idea of building a "rate my lesson" feedback system,
like the "smiley face, sad face" boards you see at airport security. We
chose as our platform the BBC microbit, a big red button and a big green
button.

We wrote a scheme of work for a day-long activity, including:
* drag-and-drop and test instructions in the web-based simulator
* download the code onto a physical microbit
* wiring up the hardware Big Buttons for like and dislike to replace the inputs into the microbit
* lots of ideas for further, advanced, work

We also dived down and wrote a detailed Lesson Plan for the first stage.
The idea is that the materials can be self-served or can be delivered by
one of us should we choose to work with a charity and take this activity
into a school. We have published what we made to a github repo that can be
freely downloaded or forked.

Additionally we wrote a short 15-minute ice-breaker activity that
introduces the ideal of imperative programming.

The team would like to carry on working on this project in our spare time, and have scheduled
a monthly meetup to track progress. The hope is to have our worksheet
finished in a year and take it into a school for #OneDay2018
